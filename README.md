# Software-Development-Lifecycle

In order to understand the users' issues and objectives, you conduct research using methods like surveys and interviews. Then, you distill that knowledge into clear, practical requirements for your program. Because they concisely describe a feature from the viewpoint of the user, user stories are a valuable tool that enable the development team to concentrate on the "why" of a feature rather than the technical "what."

I carefully plan programs that repeat cycles of planning, coding, and testing so that I can improve and keep my flexibility. I want to use Agile methods like Scrum in the future to keep things moving and encourage team members to talk to each other. These are short development sprints and regular stand-up meetings.


A good team player in software development is someone who values open and honest communication so that everyone on the team knows what the project's goals are and problems can be solved before they happen. It also means being willing to share information, work together, and give constructive criticism to help the team as a whole.
